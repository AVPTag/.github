# Oh, Hello!

What is AVPTag?

AVPTag is a method, or strategy to run the VR game titled Gorilla Tag on an Apple Vision Pro.

Why did we make this, how did we make it, and how did we come up with it?

We made it because no one has ever made it before.

We can't really share how we made it, but we made it with love. It's closed source.

We came up with it because the Apple Vision Pro with the M5 chip just came out as I am making this post. It sounds AMAZING! 

Did we ever make any other Gorilla Tag for other Operating Systems?

## Yes!

We made CardTag as well! It is a method to run Gorilla Tag on a Google Cardboard!

Okay, who is the mastermind behind this?

Of course, this is going to be updated frequently.

Wait! One more thing.

we follow legal rules. we eliminated potential ways to get into legal action by using PC VR methods.

Did we ever make any other games for the Apple Vision Pro?

## Yes!

We made AVPCraft. It is a method to run Minecraft Java on the Vision Pro. And yes, you guessed it, we made it on the Google Cardboard too.

Did we ever run into potential copyright issues on any of our repositories?

## Yes, but we have just found a loophole!

Our project, aBoot was intended to run iOS on Android, which was not legal due to DMCA and Copyright, however to Apple's EULA, they never said that you cannot make the people build it from source code instead of just distributing it. Therefore, the legal path is for the people to build it on their own.
